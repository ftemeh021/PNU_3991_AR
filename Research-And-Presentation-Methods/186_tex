\textbf{Because I Need to Learn from Others}
\end{flushleft}
The public nature of disscmination means that others will critically read and reflect on your work. This revicu may be highly formalred and undertaken by peers whose idcntities are hidden from you. Alternatively, the review may take the form of a thorough proofreading by a silled editor. Ultimately, countless members of the general public review your resulte. Fach of these reviewers will have sugisestions, concems, and even major problems with your research. Rather than vicwing this feedback as deterrents to dissemination, these reviews pruvide opportunity to hone the results and present them in ways that clearly and succinctly reveal the knowledge that you have created. Good research is a dulogue between the researcher and the many potential consumers of the results. This dialogue often continues with idcas you choose to pursue, identification of new insights, and applications of the results-as well as opportunitics for building on your prior research by identifying new questions and new opportunitics to pursue these questions.

\textbf{Because I Need to Clarify My Own Thoughts}

The final reason prowided by the Literati Club is to meet the specific needs of many different audiences. E-rescarchers, as authors, need to focur on particular audiences as they present the results of their work. By asking themselves what these results mean to different groups of knowledge consumers, additional clarity and insight often arises. This insight is then honed through successive rewrites and presentation formuts until the rescarch is packaged in such a way that the results are perccived as both accessible and of value to the intended audiencels). Normally this revision and focusing exercise brings additional insights into the work that enhance its usefulness, not only to the audience but even more so to the researcher.

\textbf{Because It Can Be Satisfying}

We add a fifth reason to publish, which may not always be attested to by struggling e-researchers. The dissemination stage is one of expansion. The development and testing of ideas is often a shrinking and focusing activity in which meaning is created by tightly focusing research tools on carefully defined and circumscribed events, ideas, or activities, In the diswemination phase, rescarchen are able to expand their thinking by creating and sharing not only the direct reults but alse the implications for practice and for further research. This opportunity to reveal the significance of your research is often the most satisfying component of the research process.

The discemination process can prowide enteruining. creative, and interactive leaming expericnces when you publish your results using the multimedia capucity of the Net. The development of enpaging Web sites that use the Web's multimedia capacities can faclitate new learning as one masters graphics, Web creation, discusain forums, and other interactive tools. This learning and playing with the presentation of your revulte is usually enjoyable work and can be a most satisfying component of the e-rescarch process.
