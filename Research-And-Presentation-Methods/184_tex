The dissemination phase of e-research is the climar of the research cycle,and
it occurs when rescarchers share the results of their important research
studies with the world. Unfortunately,it is this stage that is  fraught with  indecision and unhealthy bouts of procrastination.
In some cases,the funders of the e-research set deadlines that serve to motivate
and pace the researcher through this final sprint. However,all-toe-often in academic research,the dissemination phase comes after the defense of a formal thesis or major project,when the prant money has been spent,and in both cases,enerivy may be low. The result is that too often the outcornes of difnificant research studies femain hidden in a bound thesis resting en a dusty library shelf or filed as a completed research report in a bureaucrat's office.


We begin this chapter with an overview of the reasons why the dissemination
process is important and worth putting forth the catra enery  that
is involved. We then provide an overview on the selection of the neteorked tools best suited for this task and end with tips for
effectively and efficiently disseminating the findings of a research project.
