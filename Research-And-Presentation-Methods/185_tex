worth saying and your research efforts will make a contribution (however major or minor) to improving education and opportunities for leatning.
There are also more mundane and practical reasons for disseminating the results of your e-research work. The literati Gub (www
literaticlub.co.uk), a support site for authors sponsored by MC. U Universiry Press, provides a listing of four compelling reasons to publish.

\textbf{Because I Have To}
\end{flushleft}
Being a professor (or undertaking any of the foles associated in the long apprenticeship trail from graduate student through assistant and associate professor) means that one
make open declaration of, as of one's knowledge, belicf, action." Thus, you are asked, as a member of the research commanity, to pablicly declare what you know and what your research has revealed. This declaration is a form of accountability in which you show that the time and effort spent on your study is justifical and worthy of your per" sonal as well as secietal support.


Disseminating your materials also repays your debt to thene whose ideas and
cfforts have assisted the work. The rescarch process that you are
now completing has becn aided by many other professors who have publicly piven their insights into related problems, methodologies, and solutions. Puhlishing also helps repay thene participants who have piven their time and insights to you throughout the research process. It is now your turn to repay this social debt and add to the accumulated public knowledpe and wisdom. This is not only a great regonsibility, but it is also a great honor. The dis semination process, like all components of the e-research cycle, is marked by hard work and attention to detail. However, it is also nearest to the pay-off stage and thus can be the most rewarding component of the e-research process.

\textbf{Because I Want to Get Ahead}
\end{flushleft}
Public disemination of results often results in a flurry of contacts and connections with
knowledge and who lnows hen to conmunicate these results provides a focus to which additional epportunities gravitate. These may include offers to collaborate on furure work, invitations to speak at conferences or other patherings, invitations to travel and visit with other researchers, requests for advice or offers of further research or related employment. In aculemic circles, publishing, especially in peer-reviewed journal articles and books, is one of the few quantifiable contributions to scholarly life and thus the count of publications often takes inordinate importance in promotion, tenure, and salary decisions. Graduate students who have the beginnings of a poblishing record on their resumes are incvitably more sought after than thowe who can shoer conpetence only throuph successful completion of courses. There are a variety of personal and institutional ego-related reasons for disseminating as well. In sum there afe many compelling reasons why dissemination of results is a very reliable indicator of future success.
